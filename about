I am currently a predoctoral fellow at the Harvard Sustainability, Transparency, Accountability Research (STAR) Lab. I am also a graduate Fellow at the Weatherhead Cluster on Climate Change, as well as the Institute for Quantitative Social Science, and the Center for American Political Studies (CAPs). 
I am broadly interested in the politics of climate change with a focus on institutions and elections.
