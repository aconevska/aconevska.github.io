Hi! I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Government at Harvard University where I study the political economy of climate change.

I am currently a Graduate Fellow at the Institute for Quantitative Social Science (IQSS), the Center for American Political Studies (CAPS), and the Graduate Student Coordinator for the Weatherhead Cluster on Climate Change at Harvard. 

My research belongs to two broad streams. In one stream, I conduct applied research that can establish policy evidence relevant to the renewable energy transition. This includes my work with the Harvard Sustainability, Transparency, and Accountability Research (STAR) Lab, where I help design and implement randomized control trials on climate-related interventions with public and private sector partners.  I also use experimental methods to study voter engagement and strategic campaign messaging with a focus on climate change. 

In a second stream, I study on how new and divisive political issues, such as climate change, get effectively incorporated (or not) into government agendas and subsequent policies. I am specifically interested in the way institutions shape how political parties and interests can respond to, and incorporate such issues. Though I focus primarily on the Untied States (US), I also examine how electoral system design affects the strategies parties take to address climate change in Europe.

Finally, I am part of a group of researchers committed to digitizing Cast Vote Record (CVR) data in the United States, unlocking new research frontiers applicable to the big questions in academic as well as real world campaign strategy.
