    <p>Hi! I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Government at Harvard University where I study the political economy of climate change.</p>

    <p>My work examines how institutions shape the incentives of political parties to address climate change. I focus primarily on the United States but also examine how electoral system design affects how parties address 'new' issues in Europe. In a more applied body of work, I conduct research to establish policy evidence relevant to the energy transition. This includes my work with the <a href="https://starlab.wcfia.harvard.edu/">Harvard STAR Lab</a>, where I help implement RCTs on climate-related interventions with public and private sector partners, including the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and the Bank of Ireland. I also use experimental methods to study voter engagement and strategic campaign messaging.</p>

    <p>I am currently a Graduate Fellow at the <a href="https://www.iq.harvard.edu/about">Institute for Quantitative Social Science</a> (IQSS), the <a href="https://caps.gov.harvard.edu/">Center for American Political Studies</a> (CAPS), and the <a href="https://starlab.wcfia.harvard.edu/">Harvard STAR Lab</a>, and I am the Graduate Student Coordinator for the <a href="https://climatepipeline.hsites.harvard.edu/">Weatherhead Cluster on Climate Change</a> at Harvard. I am also part of a group of researchers committed to digitizing <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-024-04017-1">Cast Vote Record data</a> in the United States, unlocking new research frontiers applicable to big questions in academia as well as real world campaign strategy.</p>

    <p>My research has been published in <em>Nature Scientific Data</em>, <em>International Studies Quarterly</em>, <em>Climate Policy</em>, <em>Climate and Development</em>, and <em>Energy Research & Social Science</em>.</p>
