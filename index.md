Hi! I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Government at Harvard University where I study the political economy of climate change.

I study how institutions shape the incentives of political parties to respond to and address climate change. Though I focus primarily on the Untied States (US), I also examine how electoral system design affects the strategies parties take to address climate change in Europe. In a more applied body of work, I conduct research that can establish policy evidence relevant to the renewable energy transition. This includes my work with the Harvard Sustainability, Transparency, and Accountability Research (STAR) Lab, where I help design and implement randomized control trials on climate-related interventions with public and private sector partners.  I also use experimental methods to study voter engagement and strategic campaign messaging with a focus on climate change. 


I am currently a Graduate Fellow at the [Institute for Quantitative Social Science](https://www.iq.harvard.edu/about) (IQSS), the [Center for American Political Studies](https://caps.gov.harvard.edu/) (CAPS), and the [Harvard STAR Lab](https://starlab.wcfia.harvard.edu/), and the Graduate Student Coordinator for the [Weatherhead Cluster on Climate Change](https://climatepipeline.hsites.harvard.edu/) at Harvard.


I am also part of a group of researchers committed to digitizing [Cast Vote Record data](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-024-04017-1) in the United States, unlocking new research frontiers applicable to big questions in academica, as well as to real world campaign strategy. 

My research has been published in journals including _Nature Scientific Data_, _International Studies Quarterly_, _Climate Policy_, _Climate and Development_, and _Energy Research & Social Science_.
