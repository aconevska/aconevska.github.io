Hi! I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Government at Harvard University where I study the political economy of climate change.

I study how institutions shape the incentives of political parties to respond to and address climate change. Though I focus primarily on the Untied States (US), I also examine how electoral system design affects the strategies parties take to address climate change in Europe. In a more applied body of work, I conduct research that can establish policy evidence relevant to the renewable energy transition. This includes my work with the Harvard Sustainability, Transparency, and Accountability Research (STAR) Lab, where I help design and implement randomized control trials on climate-related interventions with public and private sector partners.  I also use experimental methods to study voter engagement and strategic campaign messaging with a focus on climate change. Finally, I am part of a group of researchers committed to digitizing Cast Vote Record (CVR) data in the United States, unlocking new research frontiers applicable to the big questions in academic as well as real world campaign strategy. 

I am currently a Graduate Fellow at the [Institute for Quantitative Social Science]([url](https://www.iq.harvard.edu/about)) (IQSS), the [Center for American Political Studies]([url](https://caps.gov.harvard.edu/)) (CAPS), and the [Harvard STAR Lab]([url](https://starlab.wcfia.harvard.edu/)), and the Graduate Student Coordinator for the [Weatherhead Cluster on Climate Change]([url](https://climatepipeline.hsites.harvard.edu/)) at Harvard. 

My research has been published in journals including _Nature Scientific Data_, _International Studies Quarterly_, _Climate Policy_, _Climate and Development_, and _Energy Research & Social Science_.
